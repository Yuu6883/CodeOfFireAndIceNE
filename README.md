## Note
* This is project is created to develop AI for the challenge at [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/a-code-of-ice-and-fire)
* The aim of this project is to use NE (Neural Evolution) to train AI models to play the game
* Most people hard coded their "AI" algorithms which has nothing to do with AI at all
* Because of the number of features of this game, it might be hard for the AI to perform better than human-designed (hard coded) strategy.

## Done Features
1. Game logic implemented in python so that I can use tensorflow library later for training purpose (also because I prefer Python than Java). Original game logic is available [here](https://github.com/Azkellas/a-code-of-ice-and-fire)
2. GUI implemented with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org)

## TODO
1. Define inputs and outputs for NN
2. Evolution
3. Maybe use NEAT algorithm since the inputs will be very complex

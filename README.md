# CodeOfFireAndIceNE
Open source AI for CodeOfFireAndIce challenge on codingame.com

## Note
* This is project is created to develop AI for the challenge at [codingame](https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/a-code-of-ice-and-fire)
* The aim of this project is to use NE (Neural Evolution) to train AI models to play the game
* Most people hard coded their "AI" algorithms which has nothing to do with AI at all

## Done Features
1. Game logic implemented in python so that I can use tensorflow library later for training purpose (also because I prefer Python than Java). Original game logic is available [here](https://github.com/Azkellas/a-code-of-ice-and-fire)

## TODO
1. Define inputs and outputs for NN
2.
